##The aim of this notebook is to predict which of the customers will have their loan approved.
In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc. The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed. (wikipedia)

In evaluating a machine learning model for deployment, a data scientist would ideally like to understand the behavior of the model as a whole, not just in specific instances (e.g. specific loan applicants). This is especially true in regulated industries such as banking where higher standards of explainability may be required. For example, the data scientist may have to present the model to: 1) technical and business managers for review before deployment, 2) a lending expert to compare the model to the expert's knowledge, or 3) a regulator to check for compliance. Furthermore, it is common for a model to be deployed in a different geography than the one it was trained on. A global view of the model may uncover problems with overfitting and poor generalization to other geographies before deployment.



Steps done:
1. Preprocessing and Data Analysis
2. Data visualization
3. Encoded data to numeric
4. Modeling the Data:
    Importing the model
    Fitting the model
    Predicting Loan Status
    Classification report by Loan Status
    Overall accuracy
   


Models used :
      Decision Tree
      Random Forest
      XGBoost
      Logistic Regression
